--------------

**Title:** Community Tools Workshops

**Audience:** Beginners

**Track:** Communty or Other

**Speaker:** You!


**Description:**

This half-day workshop will get you up and running with the basic tools that the Drupal community uses to tackle problems together. We’ll start with a hands-on look at our community's communication tools, starting with the Drupal.org issue queue and IRC. Then we’ll dive into getting a local development environment set up on your laptop (a web server with Drupal 8 running). We'll finish by installing Git and going over the basics of what Git is and why we use it. Once you have these tools in place, you’ll be ready to jump in and start helping make Drupal better. This workshop is especially useful for people interested in participating in core mentoring or other similar "Get Involved with Core" sprints. You will leave with the tools necessary to get started with your first Drupal contributions.

This workshop is intended for people who have worked with a Drupal site before, but are less familiar with the tools our community uses or how to get them set up. You don’t have to be a coder in order to benefit from these tools or contribute to Drupal. Everyone can get involved in the many aspects of Drupal Core Contribution, including documentation, UX, design, testing, and development—once you know where and how the community works together.

More information about this workshop and the open-source curriculum that it is based on can be found here: http://drupalize.me/community-tools

We're also looking for volunteers to help attendees get their local host ready to go during the second half of the workshop. It's a great opportunity to help new contributors get involved with Drupal. Let us know if you're interested!

**Requirements**

- While not absolutely required participants will get the most out of this workshop if they are able to bring a laptop which they can install software on since a large part of the workshop will focus on helping participants get a local development environment setup.

- A basic understanding of Drupal, and simple Drupal site administration tasks is assumed.
